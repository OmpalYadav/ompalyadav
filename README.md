## 🎬 Act 1: The Origin Story

In a world where code is king, I stepped into the lab with a simple principle:  

*"Consistency beats intensity — build, break, learn, repeat."*  

From solving **algorithms in C++** to orchestrating **AI/ML pipelines**, my journey is one of **precision, discipline, and curiosity**. Every bug fixed, every deployment pushed, is a step closer to mastery.

## 📖 Act 2: The Masterplan

**Learning, experimenting, building — repeat.**  

| Domain | Mission |
|--------|--------|
| 🧑‍💻 **DSA** | Daily challenges, problem-solving mastery in C++ |
| 🤖 **AI/ML** | Models, experiments, and applied intelligence |
| 🌐 **Full Stack** | React.js, Node.js, REST APIs, Databases |
| ☁️ **Cloud & DevOps** | AWS, Docker, CI/CD pipelines |
| 🗄️ **Core CS** | DBMS, OS, Networks, OOPs |

> Every milestone is logged in my **GitHub labs**, a chronicle of growth and experiments.
